   <h2>🇳🇿 New Zealand's Pavlova 🇳🇿</h2>

<p>Pavlova is a traditional New Zealand dessert that's often eaten during holidays and celebrations, especially in the summer. It's made of meringue, cream, and fruit, usually kiwifruit, and is often served at children's birthday parties and decorated with candy. Pavlova is believed to have been created in the 1920s to honor Russian ballerina Anna Pavlova, who toured New Zealand and Australia during that time.  Pavlova is frequently associated with celebrations and special occasions in New Zealand, such as Christmas, birthdays, and other festive gatherings. Its light, airy texture and vibrant fruit toppings make it a popular choice for these events, reflecting the celebratory and communal spirit of the occasions. The dessert's presence at such events underscores its status as a staple in New Zealand's culinary landscape.</p>
