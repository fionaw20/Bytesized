It is a way to honor the gauchos, the nomadic horsemen and cattle herders who roamed the pampas in the 19th century, and a way to respect the land & country.</p>

   <h2> ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡± Chile's Beef Empanadas ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡±</h2>
  <p> Chilean beef empanadas, or empanadas de pino, are an iconic dish that combine both Spanish and Mapuche indigenous cultures. The dish originated during the Spanish conquest of Chile in the 1600s, when Mapuche cooks began making empanadas with ingredients introduced by the Spanish. The result is a hybrid dish called pino, which is then stuffed inside a pastry. Empanadas are so ingrained in Chile's culture, that they are often served at celebrations and special events, as families & friends gather to share plates of empanadas together.</p>
